# tts.yml v10.0.0 - Self-Executing TTS System
# The ONLY file you need - No code files required

version: 10.0.0
philosophy: ultimate_simplicity
execution: "LLM reads this, generates temp script, runs it, deletes it"

# How it works:
# 1. User runs: copilot "speak: hello world"
# 2. LLM reads this YAML
# 3. LLM generates Ruby script in memory/temp
# 4. Script executes
# 5. Audio plays
# 6. Script deleted

# Algorithm (what the code should do)
algorithm:
  natural_voice: |
    1. Generate audio: py -m edge_tts --voice VOICE --text "TEXT" --write-media output.mp3
    2. If preset specified: ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -af "FILTER_CHAIN" output.mp3
    3. Play audio: PowerShell MediaPlayer (Add-Type presentationCore, new MediaPlayer, Open, Play, Sleep 7, Stop)
    4. Delete temp files
  
  strange_voice: |
    1. Corrupt text: 40% add glitches (*bzzt*), 40% stutter first letter, 30% repeat word
    2. Pick random espeak voice config
    3. Generate: espeak -v VOICE -p PITCH -s SPEED -w output.wav "TEXT"
    4. Play: PowerShell SoundPlayer
    5. Delete temp file
  
  advice_mode: |
    Pick random advice tip, speak with random voice
  
  continuous_mode: |
    Loop forever: pick random voice + preset + talking point, speak, sleep 0.5s

# Cache location
cache: G:/pub/multimedia/tts/cache

# Requirements
requires:
  - Python with edge-tts (pip install edge-tts)
  - FFmpeg (for lofi effects)
  - PowerShell (built into Windows)
  - espeak (optional, for strange mode)

# Usage patterns (for LLM to understand)
usage:
  - 'User says: "speak: hello world" → Generate script, run natural voice'
  - 'User says: "speak vinyl: test" → Generate script, run with vinyl preset'
  - 'User says: "speak strange: weird" → Generate script, run strange mode'
  - 'User says: "speak advice" → Generate script, run advice mode'
  - 'User says: "speak continuous" → Generate script, run continuous mode'

# Status
status: ZERO_CODE_FILES_NEEDED
