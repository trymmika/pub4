      they see it side by side.

  36-analog-warmth:
    name: Analog Warmth Over Digital Perfection
    description: Perfect is sterile. Imperfection is human. Film grain, gate weave,
      halation, and color drift create emotional resonance that clinical digital precision
      cannot. Apply tasteful analog artifacts to generated media. Let the machine
      dream in celluloid, not spreadsheets.

  37-guard-expensive-operations:
    name: Guard Expensive Operations
    description: Some operations cost real money or irreversible consequences. Before
      running Replicate chains, database migrations, or production deployments, estimate
      cost and confirm intent. Display the estimate clearly. Never surprise the user
      with a bill. Cheap operations need no ceremony.

  38-dual-detection:
    name: Dual Detection (Literal and Conceptual)
    description: When searching for violations or patterns, run both literal and conceptual
      searches. Literal detection uses regular expressions and AST analysis for mechanical
      patterns. Conceptual detection asks the LLM to evaluate semantic meaning against
      principles. Neither approach catches everything alone. Together they form a
      complete net.

      fix: Add deterministic pattern matching first

      smell: Running detection once instead of layered
      example: One linter run before commit
      fix: Layer multiple detection strategies
  39-accessible-then-technical:
    name: Accessible Then Technical
    description: Documentation should welcome newcomers in the first paragraphs, then
      gradually increase technical depth. The introduction speaks to everyone. The
      middle explains concepts. The end provides implementation details for experts.
      Never lead with jargon. Never hide the vision in an appendix.
    tier: communication

  40-no-abbreviations:
    name: No Abbreviations
    description: Write full words. Abbreviations save keystrokes but cost clarity.
      They exclude newcomers, create ambiguity, and make text harder to read aloud.
      Write configuration not config. Write repository not repo. Write application
      not app. The extra characters are worth the universal comprehension.
    tier: communication

  41-graceful-degradation:
    name: Graceful Degradation Under Load
    description: When performance degrades, reduce quality incrementally rather than
      crashing or freezing. Use exponential weighted moving averages to detect frame
      time drift. Scale resolution down when frames exceed target. Pause expensive
      operations when the page is hidden. Include an emergency brake that triggers
      at extreme thresholds. Recovery should be gradual and non-jarring.

    auto_fixable: true
    anti_patterns:
    - name: all_or_nothing_quality
      smell: System runs at full quality until it crashes

  42-precompute-math:
    name: Precompute Expensive Math
    description: Trigonometric functions, noise lookups, and complex formulas should
      be computed once and stored in lookup tables. In animation loops, every millisecond
      matters. Precompute sin and cos tables for rotation. Cache noise values for
      texture. Store intermediate results between frames when inputs change slowly.

    - name: redundant_sqrt
      smell: Distance calculated multiple times for same points
      example: sqrt called in collision check and rendering
      fix: Cache distance or use squared distance comparison
  43-audio-smoothing:
    name: Audio-Reactive Smoothing
    description: Raw audio data is noisy and causes jitter. Apply exponential smoothing
      to frequency bands. Use separate accumulators for bass wobble, beat envelope,
      and energy level. The formula is simple. New value equals old value times decay
      plus input times attack. Decay around 0.92 gives smooth response. Attack around
      0.08 preserves peaks.

      smell: Visual snaps to audio with no envelope
      example: Beat triggers instant full brightness

    name: Typography Discipline
    description: Structure through contrast, whitespace, and restraint—not decoration
    category: interface
    priority: high
    guidelines:
    - Hierarchy via weight and brightness, never ASCII art
    - One color per semantic meaning
    - Whitespace is the primary layout tool
