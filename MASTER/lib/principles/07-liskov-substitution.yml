tier: solid
priority: 7
auto_fixable: false
anti_patterns:
- name: refused_bequest
  smell: Subclass doesn't use inherited methods
  example: "`Square < Rectangle` that ignores `height=`"
  fix: Use composition, or don't inherit
- name: type_checking
  smell: Checking class type instead of using polymorphism
  example: "`if obj.is_a?(Dog) then bark else meow`"
  fix: Define common interface, let each type implement
