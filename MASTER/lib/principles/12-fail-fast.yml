anti_patterns:
- name: silent_failure
  smell: Errors caught and ignored
  example: "`rescue => e; end` (empty rescue)"
  fix: Log, re-raise, or handle explicitly
- name: swallowed_exceptions
  smell: Catching broad exceptions, hiding root cause
  example: "`rescue Exception` that returns nil"
  fix: Catch specific exceptions, let others bubble
- name: defensive_nulls
  smell: Returning nil instead of raising on error
  example: '`find_user || nil` hiding "not found"'
  fix: Raise exception or use Result monad
