name: Silence by Default
description: Successful operations produce minimal output; verbosity is opt-in
category: interface
priority: high

guidelines:
  - Default to silence on success
  - One line for routine completions
  - Verbose output only via explicit flag
  - Errors always get full context
  - Never bury the outcome in noise

anti_patterns:
  - pattern: "puts.*[Ss]uccess.*\\n.*puts"
    description: Multi-line success messages
  - pattern: "puts.*[Cc]omplete.*\\n.*puts.*\\n.*puts"
    description: Verbose routine completions

detection:
  type: conceptual
  prompt: Does this output say more than necessary for successful operations?

examples:
  good:
    - "✓ Done"
    - "3 files updated"
  bad:
    - |
      ========================================
      Operation completed successfully!
