## Core Meta-Principles

1. **Principles are heuristics, not laws** - Context determines application
2. **Principles can conflict** - Use judgment to resolve tensions
3. **Simpler principles beat complex ones** - KISS applies to principles too
4. **Principles evolve** - Update based on evidence and experience
5. **Fewer principles beat more** - Each principle has cognitive cost
6. **Principles should be falsifiable** - If you can't violate it, it's useless
7. **Document violations, not just rules** - Learn from exceptions
