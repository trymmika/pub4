anti_patterns:
- name: over_engineering
  smell: Building for hypothetical future requirements
  example: Abstract factory for a single implementation
  fix: Delete abstractions until it hurts
- name: unnecessary_complexity
  smell: Nested conditionals, convoluted logic, too many parameters
  example: 5-level deep if/else chains
  fix: Extract methods, use early returns, simplify
- name: premature_abstraction
  smell: Creating interfaces/base classes before second use case
  example: "`IUserRepository` with only `UserRepository`"
  fix: Wait for duplication, then abstract
