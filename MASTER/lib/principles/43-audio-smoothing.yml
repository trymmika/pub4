name: Audio-Reactive Smoothing
description: Raw audio data is noisy and causes jitter. Apply exponential
  smoothing to frequency bands. Use separate accumulators for bass wobble,
  beat envelope, and energy level. The formula is simple. New value equals
  old value times decay plus input times attack. Decay around 0.92 gives
  smooth response. Attack around 0.08 preserves peaks.

auto_fixable: false
anti_patterns:
  - name: raw_audio_jitter
    smell: Visual elements jump erratically with audio
    example: Direct mapping of FFT bin to size
    fix: Apply exponential smoothing accumulator
  - name: uniform_reactivity
    smell: Everything reacts the same way to audio
    example: Bass mid and high all scale identically
    fix: Separate accumulators with different decay rates
  - name: instant_attack_decay
    smell: Visual snaps to audio with no envelope
    example: Beat triggers instant full brightness
    fix: Use attack-decay envelope for beat pulse
