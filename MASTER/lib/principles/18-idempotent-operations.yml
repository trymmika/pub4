priority: 18
auto_fixable: false
anti_patterns:
- name: non_idempotent_mutations
  smell: Repeated calls produce different results
  example: "`increment_counter()` called twice = +2"
  fix: Use `set_counter(value)` instead
- name: unsafe_retries
  smell: Retry logic without idempotency keys
  example: Payment API retried without dedup
  fix: Add idempotency key, check before processing
