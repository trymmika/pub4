name: Graceful Degradation Under Load
description: When performance degrades, reduce quality incrementally rather than
  crashing or freezing. Use exponential weighted moving averages to detect frame
  time drift. Scale resolution down when frames exceed target. Pause expensive
  operations when the page is hidden. Include an emergency brake that triggers
  at extreme thresholds. Recovery should be gradual and non-jarring.

anti_patterns:
  - name: all_or_nothing_quality
    smell: System runs at full quality until it crashes
    example: No frame rate detection or quality adjustment
    fix: Add EWMA frame timing and dynamic resolution scaling
  - name: hidden_tab_burn
    smell: Full rendering continues when tab is hidden
    example: Animation loop ignores visibility state
    fix: Check document.hidden and throttle or pause
  - name: no_emergency_brake
    smell: Runaway performance spiral with no floor
    example: Quality degrades forever without hard limit
    fix: Set minimum quality floor and emergency reset
