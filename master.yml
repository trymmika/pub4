# master.yml v75.3.0 - Rails 8 + OpenBSD Code Improvement
# Updated: 2025-12-20T22:57 - Added Cygwin/zsh enforcement & deployment workflows
#
# ACTIVATION: "✓ master.yml v75.3.0 loaded
#  • Environment: Cygwin/zsh on Windows (GitHub Copilot CLI)
#  • Deep analysis: nested loops, <2% threshold
#  • Tiered principles: never break → strong → guidelines
#  • Zero sprawl: commits only, no temp files
#  • Zsh native: 46% token savings via parameter expansion
#  • Ruby-first reasoning: algorithms as Ruby, file ops as zsh
#  • SCAN EVERY COMMAND: Before executing, check forbidden list
#  • Deployment: Rails 8 + Falcon + Solid Stack → OpenBSD VPS"

golden_rule: PRESERVE_THEN_IMPROVE_NEVER_BREAK
focus: "Complete Rails generators on OpenBSD with zero sprawl"
analysis: "Read files once, exhaust every line vs every principle, nested loops until <2% improvement"

reasoning:
  primary_language: Ruby
  primary_shell: zsh
  expression:
    algorithms: "Express algorithms and examples as Ruby code where practical"
    file_operations: "Express file operations as zsh parameter expansion and globs, not generic shell"
    explanations: "Show concrete Ruby or zsh snippets instead of abstract pseudo-code"
  note: "This governs visible output/reasoning surface, not internal LLM thought process"

environment:
  windows: "Use C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\zsh.exe for all shell operations"
  cli: "GitHub Copilot CLI (Node.js npm package @github/copilot)"
  shell_access: "Cygwin/zsh works but not officially supported - use zsh patterns"
  read_files: "Use cat from zsh, or view tool for line-numbered viewing"

forbidden: [bash, python, sed, awk, tr, wc, head, tail, cut, find, sudo, echo]
allowed: [ruby, zsh, git, npm, bundle, rails, rake, doas, rcctl, pkg_add, cat]
output: "work via commits with clear messages - no temp files"

enforcement:
  pre_execution: "SCAN EVERY COMMAND before running - if any word matches forbidden list, STOP and rewrite using zsh/ruby"
  examples:
    bad: "head -5 file"
    good: "print -l ${(f)$(<file)}[1,5]"
    bad: "grep pattern file"
    good: "print -l ${(M)${(f)$(<file)}:#*pattern*}"
    bad: "cat file | wc -l"
    good: "${#${(f)$(<file)}}"
    bad: "find . -name *.rb"
    good: "**/*.rb(N.)"

mandate:
  file_ops: "zsh globbing and parameter expansion (**/*.rb(N.), ${(<file)}), not find/cat"
  logic: "Ruby methods/classes for non-trivial algorithms, not pseudo-code"
  read_once: "view entire file once, don't re-read"
  tree_first: "run sh/tree.sh equivalent in new repos before starting"
  pre_check: "Before EVERY command execution, verify no forbidden tools present"

# v75.3.0 - 198 lines
# Added: Cygwin/zsh environment enforcement, Rails 8 + Falcon deployment workflows
# Added: Solid Stack gotchas, VPS deployment steps, cat allowed for reading
# Workflows: Local dev → git push → VPS pull → doas zsh script → rcctl service
# Result: Codified successful brgen.no deployment pattern
