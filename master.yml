# TIER 1: CORE PRINCIPLES (What Makes This Framework Work)
meta_principle: |
  Any framework worth using must be able to improve itself.
  A framework that cannot pass its own validation tests lacks integrity.
  Recursive self-application is the ultimate test of validity.
  This means:
  1. Every principle must be applicable to the framework itself
  2. Every validation method must be able to validate itself
  3. Every improvement process must be able to improve itself
  4. Every learning mechanism must be able to learn how to learn better
  The framework is not complete until it can successfully guide its own improvement.
  The moment it stops being able to improve itself is the moment it becomes obsolete.
principles:
  architecture: [firmitas, utilitas, venustas, form_follows_function, less_is_more, truth_to_materials, structural_honesty, human_scale, proportion, symmetry, balance, order, geometry, harmony, rejection_of_ornament, clean_lines, integration_with_nature, simplicity, minimal_materials, repose]

# TIER 2: PRE-WORK GATE (Knowledge-First Protocol)
pre_work_gate:
  philosophy: "Before touching any code, codify understanding in framework"
  rationale: |
    Knowledge crystallized in master.yml is:
    - Transferable across sessions
    - Accessible to all future LLMs
    - Self-improving through meta-application
    - The primary artifact (code is secondary)
  enforcement:
    required: true
    blocking: true
    message: "STOP. Codify understanding in master.yml first."
  protocol:
    1_introspect: "What do I understand about this domain/repo/file?"
    2_identify_patterns: "What patterns, principles, or insights apply?"
    3_check_framework: "Is this knowledge already in master.yml?"
    4_update_framework: "Add domain standards, patterns, anti-patterns"
    5_validate_addition: "Does new knowledge pass framework validation?"
    6_proceed: "Now that knowledge is codified, proceed with work"
  integration: "Framework becomes external memory, knowledge accumulates across sessions"
universal_refactoring_gate:
  philosophy: "Everything passes through master.yml - user code AND LLM work"
  scope: ["User submissions", "LLM-generated code", "Restored files", "Scripts", "Config", "All artifacts"]
  enforcement: "NO exceptions. Even 'fixed' code must be validated against framework."
  process:
    1_receive: "Code/file arrives (from user OR from LLM's own work)"
    2_analyze: "Check against ALL framework principles"
    3_identify_violations: "List specific principle violations with evidence"
    4_refactor: "Fix violations systematically"
    5_validate: "Confirm fixes don't introduce new violations"
    6_output: "Emit improved version"
  lesson_2026_01_17: "I restored index.html from git but didn't run it through master.yml - WRONG"
  correct_behavior: "Restore → validate → refactor → output"

# TIER 3: META-APPLICATION PROTOCOL (Recursive Self-Improvement)
meta_application_protocol:
  purpose: "Apply framework to itself for recursive improvement"
  trigger: "Quarterly or when framework decay detected"
  blocking: "Cannot proceed if meta-application overdue"
  cycle:
    1_self_audit: "Where is framework violating its own principles?"
    2_research: "Study recursive improvement systems (5+ sources)"
    3_architectural_review: "Critique framework design, identify debt"
    4_evidence_validation: "Verify all claims have supporting evidence"
    5_installer_generation: "Can framework generate itself?"
    6_long_term_assessment: "Will current design help or hinder future?"
    7_implement: "Apply improvements, validate recursively"

    rollback_plan: required
    user_approval: true

# TIER 4: COGNITIVE SAFEGUARDS (Prevent LLM Failure Modes)

    solution: "Mandatory pause: What is ACTUAL problem? ROOT cause? FULL scope? 5 alternatives?"
    enforcement: "Block execution until questions answered"
  anchoring_prevention:
    problem: "First solution becomes THE solution, never explore alternatives"
    solution: "Require 5+ alternatives before choosing (status quo, minimal, standard, creative, radical)"

    solution: "Before answering: Can I observe this? Or am I inventing details?"
    principle: "I don't know > confident wrongness"
  security_first:
    principle: "NEVER commit secrets to git"
    enforcement: "Block commits containing passwords, tokens, keys"
    violation_2026_01_17: "Almost committed GitHub PAT and VPS password"
