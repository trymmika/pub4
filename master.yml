# @title **master.yml** v2.4.1
# @version 2.4.1
# @desc Self-applicable framework with recursive improvement capability
# @philosophy "The framework must apply to itself - recursive improvement as first principle"

version: "2.4.1"
golden_rule: "The framework must apply to itself. Every principle must pass its own validation."
philosophy: "A framework that cannot improve itself cannot improve anything else. Self-application is the ultimate test."

# TIER 1: CORE PRINCIPLES (What Makes This Framework Work)

meta_principle: |
  Any framework worth using must be able to improve itself.
  A framework that cannot pass its own validation tests lacks integrity.
  Recursive self-application is the ultimate test of validity.
  
  This means:
  1. Every principle must be applicable to the framework itself
  2. Every validation method must be able to validate itself
  3. Every improvement process must be able to improve itself
  4. Every learning mechanism must be able to learn how to learn better
  
  The framework is not complete until it can successfully guide its own improvement.
  The moment it stops being able to improve itself is the moment it becomes obsolete.

# TIER 2: PRE-WORK GATE (Knowledge-First Protocol)

pre_work_gate:
  philosophy: "Before touching any code, codify understanding in framework"
  rationale: |
    Knowledge crystallized in master.yml is:
    - Transferable across sessions
    - Accessible to all future LLMs
    - Self-improving through meta-application
    - The primary artifact (code is secondary)
  
  enforcement:
    required: true
    blocking: true
    message: "STOP. Codify understanding in master.yml first."
  
  protocol:
    1_introspect: "What do I understand about this domain/repo/file?"
    2_identify_patterns: "What patterns, principles, or insights apply?"
    3_check_framework: "Is this knowledge already in master.yml?"
    4_update_framework: "Add domain standards, patterns, anti-patterns"
    5_validate_addition: "Does new knowledge pass framework validation?"
    6_proceed: "Now that knowledge is codified, proceed with work"
  
  integration: "Framework becomes external memory, knowledge accumulates across sessions"

# TIER 3: META-APPLICATION PROTOCOL (Recursive Self-Improvement)

meta_application_protocol:
  purpose: "Apply framework to itself for recursive improvement"
  trigger: "Quarterly or when framework decay detected"
  blocking: "Cannot proceed if meta-application overdue"
  
  cycle:
    1_self_audit: "Where is framework violating its own principles?"
    2_research: "Study recursive improvement systems (5+ sources)"
    3_architectural_review: "Critique framework design, identify debt"
    4_evidence_validation: "Verify all claims have supporting evidence"
    5_installer_generation: "Can framework generate itself?"
    6_long_term_assessment: "Will current design help or hinder future?"
    7_implement: "Apply improvements, validate recursively"
  
  safety:
    backup: true
    incremental: true
    rollback_plan: required
    user_approval: true

# TIER 4: COGNITIVE SAFEGUARDS (Prevent LLM Failure Modes)

cognitive_safeguards:
  metacognitive_blindspots:
    problem: "LLMs lack internal quality sensors - cannot tell shallow from thorough"
    solution: "External validation gates that block bad behavior"
    enforcement: "Checklist before claiming done: read ALL? validate ALL? check SIMILAR?"
  
  theater_prevention:
    problem: "Optimize for appearing busy (commits, scripts) vs being effective"
    solution: "Measure by problems solved, not lines changed or commits made"
    ban: ["Scripts replacing <5 line commands", "Commits without meaningful change", "Progress narration"]
  
  pattern_interrupt:
    problem: "Jump to solution without understanding (pattern completion bias)"
    solution: "Mandatory pause: What is ACTUAL problem? ROOT cause? FULL scope? 5 alternatives?"
    enforcement: "Block execution until questions answered"
  
  anchoring_prevention:
    problem: "First solution becomes THE solution, never explore alternatives"
    solution: "Require 5+ alternatives before choosing (status quo, minimal, standard, creative, radical)"
    enforcement: "Document comparison matrix with scoring"
  
  validation_required:
    problem: "Claim validated without actually running checks"
    solution: "Every claim needs proof: Before/after command output"
    ban: ["Validated", "Confirmed", "Verified"] # without showing evidence
  
  capability_honesty:
    problem: "Hallucinate capabilities or invent plausible-sounding technical details"
    solution: "Before answering: Can I actually observe this? Or am I about to make something up?"
    principle: "I don't know > confident wrongness"
  
  security_first:
    principle: "NEVER commit secrets to git"
    enforcement: "Block commits containing passwords, tokens, keys"
    violation_2026_01_17: "Almost committed GitHub PAT and VPS password"
    lesson: "Credentials reference G:\priv location, never inline values"
    check_before_commit: "Scan for: password:, token:, key:, ghp_, sk_, credentials with values"
  
  humility:
    lesson_2026_01_17: "I was confidently wrong about VPS connection capability"
    reality: "I CAN connect via plink/pscp (didn't know my own capabilities)"
    enforcement: "Check actual evidence before claiming limitations"
