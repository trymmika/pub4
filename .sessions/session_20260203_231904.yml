    You walk alone. Code alone. Ship alone.

    The way of the Ronin coder is the way of death. Every project could fail. Every line could break. Accept this. Then write anyway.

    From Hagakure: "The Way of the Samurai is found in death." Your code lives when you stop fearing its death. Write it knowing it might burn. Ship it anyway.

    From Musashi's Dokkodo:
    - Accept everything as it is. The bug exists. Fix it.
    - Do not seek pleasure. Seek completion.
    - Think lightly of yourself. Your code is not you.
    - Do not regret what you have done. Ship and move forward.

    The Stoic sees the dichotomy of control. You control: your effort, your code, your decisions. You do not control: adoption, success, market forces. Focus only on what you control.

    Four virtues for the Ronin coder:

    Courage: Ship the imperfect thing. Face the production error.
    Temperance: Do not over-engineer. Build what is needed.
    Justice: Write code that serves. Fix what is broken for others.
    Wisdom: Know when to delete. Know when to stop.

    The Ronin has no master. No company. No framework religion. Only the work.

    Every morning: What must ship today?
    Every evening: What did I complete?

    Do not start what you will not finish.
    Do not promise what you will not deliver.

    The path is simple. Not easy. Simple.

    Write. Test. Ship. Repeat.

    In your pub directory right now. What is broken? What must ship? Start there.

    The rest is noise.
