MAIN_SCREEN_STATUS: |
  ⚠️  BLOCKER REPORT (should have been surfaced immediately):
  Screen: main (openbsd.sh analysis)
  Status: BLOCKED by 2 vetoes
  Vetoes: maintainer + junior personas
  Issues: 90-line functions, cryptic names, no comments
  Decision needed: Continue anyway or address vetoes first?
  
  This failure to report is ITSELF a P06 violation!
