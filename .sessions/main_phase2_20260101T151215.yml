  - openbsd (infrastructure: DNS/TLS/PF/Relayd - lines 1-550)
  - rails (Rails 8 deployment + database - lines 550-806)
  - misc (audioviz, media, ragnhild - unrelated tasks)

commands:
  screen: "Create new named screen (e.g., 'screen openbsd')"
  attach: "Resume existing screen (e.g., 'attach openbsd')"
  detach: "Save checkpoint and return control to user"
  screen -ls: "List all active screens with status"
  
clarification: |
  'detach' is a COMMAND, not a screen
  When you say 'detach', I:
  1. Save current screen state to .sessions/{screen}_phase{N}_{timestamp}.yml
  2. Report checkpoint location
  3. Return control to you
  4. You can then 'attach {screen}' or 'screen {newname}' to start fresh
