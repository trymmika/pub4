    Hey.

    What do you need?

  :content: isnt brgen.no:40810 working?
- :role: assistant

    I cannot see if brgen.no:40810 is working without checking it.

    To verify:
    - run: curl -I http://brgen.no:40810
    - or: nc -zv brgen.no 40810

    If testing from this machine, run those commands and show me output.

    I won't guess network status.

  :content: youre supposed to route cli.html on startup to http random port

    You need to serve cli.html on a random HTTP port at startup.

    Current setup analysis needed. Run:

    cat cli.rb

    This will show how the app currently starts. Need to see if httpd or relayd integration exists.

    For OpenBSD native serving, you have options:

    1. Use httpd(8) - chrooted in /var/www by default
    2. Use WEBrick/Rack in Ruby directly
    3. Use relayd(8) for TLS termination

    Most direct for random port: Ruby WEBrick in cli.rb startup.

    Show me cli.rb first.
