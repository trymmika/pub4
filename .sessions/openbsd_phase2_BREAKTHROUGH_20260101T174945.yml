breakthrough: |
  Found corruption root cause (byte 0x01 SOH)
  Replaced with clean version from railsy repo
  Syntax validates perfectly now
  
progress:
  corruption_diagnosed: "Byte 0x01 in function declarations"
  clean_source: "https://github.com/anon987654321/railsy/blob/main/openbsd/openbsd.sh"
  syntax_valid: true
  commit: "7d876e7"
  
next_steps: |
  Clean file ready for master.yml refactoring:
  1. Remove || true patterns
  2. Add rationale for sleep delays
  3. Refactor duplicate patterns
  4. Document magic numbers
  5. Test deployment
  
lessons_learned: |
  - Binary corruption can hide in git history
  - Always check reference implementations
  - PowerShell Set-Content can introduce encoding issues
  - Web download preserves clean encoding better than git checkout
