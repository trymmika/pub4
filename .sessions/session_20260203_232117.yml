    Hey.

    What needs doing?
- :role: user
  :content: see master.yml in cwd

    I'll check the master.yml file in the pub directory.

    ```
    <read_file>
    <path>pub/master.yml</path>
    </read_file>
    ```

    The file doesn't exist. Let me see what's in the pub directory.

    ```
    <list_files>
    <path>pub</path>
    <recursive>false</recursive>
    </list_files>
    ```
