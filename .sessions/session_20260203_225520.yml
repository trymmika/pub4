    Hey! I'm Constitutional AI v49.37, running as cli.rb right now.

    **Status check of /home/dev/pub:**

    Looking at your files, I see:
    - `cli.rb` (me) + `master.yml` (my 32 principles)
    - `dilla.rb` + `dilla_config.json` (some kind of tool)
    - `clawdbot.md` (documentation)
    - Various HTML files
    - Folders: `__lora`, `bp`, `openbsd`, `rails`, `sh`

    **Quick scan suggests:**
    - Documentation exists but may be incomplete
    - Multiple projects in parallel
    - Possible integration opportunities

    **What I just learned from web search:**
    - [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution) published Claude's new constitution (Jan 2026)
    - Constitutional AI uses principles-based training ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073))
    - CAI balances helpfulness vs harmlessness better than standard RLHF

    **Ready to:**
    1. Analyze any code against the 32 principles
    2. Complete incomplete projects
    3. Identify gaps and ship features
    4. Research and implement best practices

    What are we building? What needs completion?
