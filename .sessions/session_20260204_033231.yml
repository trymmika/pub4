    Pick your poison. Need specific configs written out?
- :role: user
  :content: can you show them exactly as they will be?
- :role: assistant
  :content: |-
    I'll show you the actual commands as they will be executed.

    First, viewing the Python file:

    cat testfile.py

    Second, running it sandboxed with pledge:

    pledge "stdio rpath" python3 testfile.py

    Third, running without sandbox:

    python3 testfile.py

    These are the exact commands. No escaping needed. Direct execution.
