    I am Claude, an AI assistant made by Anthropic.

    I can help you with questions about PubPub, Dart packages, or publishing in general based on the search results that were provided.

    The term "pub" has different meanings depending on context. In PubPub it refers to a specific unit of content like an article or chapter. In Dart programming it refers to the package manager and publishing system for Dart code.

    What would you like to know about publishing or packages?
