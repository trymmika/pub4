session_insights:
  - The LLM should know it's running on a clean, minimal system
  - Boot sequence should mirror OpenBSD dmesg authentically
  - Multi-model deliberation produces better results than single model
  - Prompt enhancement via chamber before sending to main model
  - Hostile questioning surfaces hidden assumptions

items:
  - Connect orb animations to live token stream via SSE
  - Auto-detect response sentiment and update orb mood
  - Ferrum browser should return structured markdown
  - Add image comparison using LLaVA in creative chamber
  - Implement rolling summary compression for long sessions
  - Persist conversation history across CLI restarts
  - Add pledge/unveil integration for OpenBSD security
  - Stream LLM responses token-by-token to UI
  - Add semantic caching with embeddings
  - Auto-apply relevant principles based on detected file type

workflow_codified:
  - analyze: Scan codebase for refinement opportunities
  - prioritize: Rank by impact * inverse_effort
  - deliberate: Send to chamber for multi-model review
  - apply: Cherry-pick winning proposals
  - validate: Syntax check, tests if available
  - reflect: Introspect on what was learned
  - wishlist: Generate improvements for next session
  - repeat: Run again with new wishlist as context

meta_observations:
  - This wishlist file is itself part of the system
  - The evolve.rb workflow can read this and continue
  - Each session adds to collective intelligence
  - Principles + introspection + chamber = self-improving system
