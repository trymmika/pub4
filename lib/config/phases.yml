# Workflow phases - 7-phase development lifecycle
# Each phase ends with introspection
---
phases:
  - id: 1
    name: discover
    goal: Understand actual need
    output: Problem statement with success criteria
    gates:
      - no_vague_words
      - audience_identified
      - success_measurable
    introspect: "What did I miss? What assumptions did I make?"

  - id: 2
    name: analyze
    goal: Break into components
    output: Component diagram with dependencies
    gates:
      - components_distinct
      - dependencies_acyclic
    introspect: "Did I understand the real constraints? What's still unclear?"

  - id: 3
    name: ideate
    goal: Generate alternatives
    output: List of approaches with trade-offs
    gates:
      - trade_offs_documented
    introspect: "Did I explore enough options? Was I too conservative?"

  - id: 4
    name: design
    goal: Specific architecture
    output: Interface definitions and error handling
    gates:
      - interfaces_explicit
      - errors_documented
    introspect: "Is this overengineered? Is it underengineered?"

  - id: 5
    name: implement
    goal: Execute with zero violations
    output: Working code at 100/100 score
    gates:
      - tests_pass
      - zero_violations
    introspect: "What shortcuts did I take? What would I do differently?"

  - id: 6
    name: validate
    goal: Prove with evidence
    output: Test results, benchmarks
    gates:
      - zero_test_failures
      - edge_cases_covered
    introspect: "Did I test the right things? What's still risky?"

  - id: 7
    name: deliver
    goal: Ship with monitoring
    output: Deployed code with dashboards
    gates:
      - deployed
      - monitoring_configured
    introspect: "Is this truly ready? What will the user actually experience?"

# Introspection runs automatically at end of each phase
# Hostile questioning can be triggered manually: `introspect <principle>`
