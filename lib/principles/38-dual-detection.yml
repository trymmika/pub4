name: Dual Detection (Literal and Conceptual)
description: When searching for violations or patterns, run both literal and
  conceptual searches. Literal detection uses regular expressions and AST
  analysis for mechanical patterns. Conceptual detection asks the LLM to
  evaluate semantic meaning against principles. Neither approach catches
  everything alone. Together they form a complete net.

anti_patterns:
- name: regex_only
  smell: Relying solely on pattern matching
  example: Checking for long methods but missing conceptual bloat
  fix: Add LLM-based semantic analysis
- name: llm_only
  smell: Relying solely on LLM judgment
  example: Missing obvious syntactic violations
  fix: Add deterministic pattern matching first
- name: single_pass
  smell: Running detection once instead of layered
  example: One linter run before commit
  fix: Layer multiple detection strategies
