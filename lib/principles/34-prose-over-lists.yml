name: Prose Over Lists
description: Flowing prose is easier to read than bullet points, numbered lists,
  or tables. Lists fragment ideas and force the reader to reconstruct meaning.
  Prose carries momentum and context. Reserve lists only for truly enumerable
  items like command flags or model names. Never use lists for concepts, steps,
  or explanations.

anti_patterns:
  - name: bullet_point_thinking
    smell: Ideas expressed as disconnected bullets
    example: "Features: - Fast - Secure - Simple"
    fix: Write a sentence connecting the ideas
  - name: numbered_steps
    smell: Instructions as numbered list instead of narrative
    example: "1. Open file 2. Edit 3. Save"
    fix: Describe the workflow as continuous prose
  - name: table_abuse
    smell: Tables used for non-tabular data
    example: Table with two columns for key-value pairs
    fix: Write prose or use simple inline format
