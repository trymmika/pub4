- name: silent_spending
  smell: API calls without cost visibility
  example: Running video generation without showing estimated cost
  fix: Display cost estimate before execution
- name: accidental_production
  smell: Destructive operations without confirmation
  example: Database drop without explicit confirmation
  fix: Require explicit opt-in for dangerous actions
- name: runaway_loops
  smell: Unbounded iteration over expensive operations
  example: Retry loop on paid API without limit
  fix: Set hard limits and circuit breakers
