name: Dependency Inversion (SOLID D)
description: Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
tier: solid
priority: 9
auto_fixable: false
anti_patterns:
- name: tight_coupling
  smell: Class directly instantiates its dependencies
  example: "`def initialize; @db = PostgreSQL.new; end`"
  fix: Inject dependencies through constructor
- name: hard_coded_dependencies
  smell: Concrete class names scattered throughout code
  example: "`HTTPClient.get(url)` called in 20 places"
  fix: Inject abstraction, swap implementations easily
