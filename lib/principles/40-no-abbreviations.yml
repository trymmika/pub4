name: No Abbreviations
description: Write full words. Abbreviations save keystrokes but cost clarity.
  They exclude newcomers, create ambiguity, and make text harder to read aloud.
  Write configuration not config. Write repository not repo. Write application
  not app. The extra characters are worth the universal comprehension.

- name: jargon_soup
  smell: Text dense with abbreviations
  example: "Config the repo's env vars for the app's API"
  fix: Expand all abbreviations to full words
- name: inconsistent_abbreviation
  smell: Same term abbreviated differently
  example: "config" and "cfg" in same file
  fix: Pick full word and use it everywhere
- name: ambiguous_shorthand
  smell: Abbreviation with multiple meanings
  example: "auth" meaning authentication or authorization
  fix: Write the full word to remove ambiguity
