name: Mass Generation with Curation
description: When quality matters, generate many variations and curate ruthlessly.
  Create sixty to seventy alternatives, score them objectively, keep only the
  best eight. This applies to images, code solutions, design options, and prose.
  Humans are bad at imagining alternatives but good at recognizing quality when
  they see it side by side.
