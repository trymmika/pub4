name: Squint Test (Visual Rhythm)
description: Code and documents should look pleasing from afar. When you squint
  or blur your vision, the visual structure should reveal balanced paragraphs,
  consistent indentation, breathing room, and no walls of text. Good code has
  rhythm you can see before you can read.
