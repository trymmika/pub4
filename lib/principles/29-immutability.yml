anti_patterns:
- name: mutable_shared_state
  smell: Multiple threads/functions modify same object
  example: Global config hash modified at runtime
  fix: Freeze objects, use thread-local copies
- name: defensive_copies_needed
  smell: Must copy data to prevent corruption
  example: "`arr.dup` everywhere to avoid mutation"
  fix: Use frozen/immutable data structures by default
