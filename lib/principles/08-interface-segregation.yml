name: Interface Segregation (SOLID I)
description: Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use.
tier: solid
priority: 8
auto_fixable: false
anti_patterns:
- name: fat_interface
  smell: Interface with too many methods
  example: "`IRepository` with 30 methods, most unused"
  fix: Split into smaller role-based interfaces
- name: forced_implementation
  smell: Empty or stub implementations of interface methods
  example: "`def unused_method; raise NotImplementedError; end`"
  fix: Remove method from interface, use mixins
