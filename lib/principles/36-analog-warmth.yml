name: Analog Warmth Over Digital Perfection
description: Perfect is sterile. Imperfection is human. Film grain, gate weave,
  halation, and color drift create emotional resonance that clinical digital
  precision cannot. Apply tasteful analog artifacts to generated media. Let the
  machine dream in celluloid, not spreadsheets.
