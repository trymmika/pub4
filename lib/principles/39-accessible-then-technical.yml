name: Accessible Then Technical
description: Documentation should welcome newcomers in the first paragraphs, then
  gradually increase technical depth. The introduction speaks to everyone. The
  middle explains concepts. The end provides implementation details for experts.
  Never lead with jargon. Never hide the vision in an appendix.
