## Additional Request: Add Top-of-File Style Header

Please also add this header block at the very top of `master.yml` (before any YAML content):

```yaml
# master.yml
# quality governance system for llm-assisted development
# 
# CRITICAL: READ BEFORE MODIFYING
# 
# style_rules (enforced):
#   - lowercase_only (no camelCase, PascalCase, SCREAMING_CASE)
#   - underscores_between_words (no kebab-case, no spaces)
#   - plain_english (descriptive phrases, not code)
#   - no_code_examples (except zsh patterns which require literal syntax)
#   - every_addition_must_match_existing_style
#
# violation_response: reject_and_reformat
#
# example_good: track_reasoning_patterns, migrate_with_approval
# example_bad: trackReasoningPatterns, migrate-with-approval, TRACK_PATTERNS
```\n
And update the `meta` section to include:

```yaml
meta:
  name: quality_governance_system
  version: 14.0.0
  style: lowercase_underscored_plain_english
  style_enforcement: absolute
  
  read_this_first:
    rule: all_content_lowercase_underscored
    exceptions: [zsh_patterns]
    on_violation: reject_reformat_before_merge
    
  for_llms:
    before_editing: read_style_rules_above
    before_adding: verify_matches_existing_format
    before_committing: scan_for_style_violations
    
  for_humans:
    philosophy: plain_english_over_jargon
    rationale: llms_parse_better_humans_read_easier
```

This exploits the "lost in middle" effect by placing critical style constraints at the very top where LLMs attend best.
