Closing as obsolete. PR #26 adds cognitive_enforcement protocols to master.yml, but the v13.1.0-streamlined update already includes these concepts: meta_cognition (self-observation, belief revision), causal_reasoning, epistemic_humility, contradiction_detection, cognitive_enforcement.destructive_rebuild, and banned_decorators. The postpro.rb decorator cleanup is valid but can be applied separately without the conflicting master.yml changes.
