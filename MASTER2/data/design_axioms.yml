heuristics:
  - id: 1
    name: "Visibility of system status"
    description: "The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time."
    examples:
      - "Show loading indicators during long operations"
      - "Display progress bars for multi-step processes"
      - "Provide clear error messages with context"
      - "Indicate current state in navigation"
    
  - id: 2
    name: "Match between system and the real world"
    description: "The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon."
    examples:
      - "Use plain language instead of technical jargon"
      - "Follow real-world conventions"
      - "Present information in a natural and logical order"
      - "Use familiar metaphors and icons"
    
  - id: 3
    name: "User control and freedom"
    description: "Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked 'emergency exit' to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process."
    examples:
      - "Provide undo and redo functionality"
      - "Allow users to cancel operations"
      - "Enable easy navigation back to previous states"
      - "Avoid forcing users into specific workflows"
    
  - id: 4
    name: "Consistency and standards"
    description: "Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions."
    examples:
      - "Use consistent terminology throughout"
      - "Follow established UI patterns"
      - "Maintain consistent styling and layout"
      - "Adhere to platform conventions"
    
  - id: 5
    name: "Error prevention"
    description: "Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place."
    examples:
      - "Validate input before submission"
      - "Provide constraints and guardrails"
      - "Use confirmation dialogs for destructive actions"
      - "Offer helpful suggestions and defaults"
    
  - id: 6
    name: "Recognition rather than recall"
    description: "Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another."
    examples:
      - "Show available options and commands"
      - "Provide autocomplete and suggestions"
      - "Display recent items and history"
      - "Use visual cues and labels"
    
  - id: 7
    name: "Flexibility and efficiency of use"
    description: "Shortcuts may speed up the interaction for expert users such that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users."
    examples:
      - "Provide keyboard shortcuts"
      - "Allow customization and preferences"
      - "Offer batch operations"
      - "Enable power-user features"
    
  - id: 8
    name: "Aesthetic and minimalist design"
    description: "Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information competes with relevant units and diminishes their relative visibility."
    examples:
      - "Remove unnecessary elements"
      - "Focus on essential content"
      - "Use white space effectively"
      - "Keep interfaces clean and uncluttered"
    
  - id: 9
    name: "Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors"
    description: "Error messages should be expressed in plain language, precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution."
    examples:
      - "Use clear, non-technical error messages"
      - "Explain what went wrong and why"
      - "Suggest specific recovery actions"
      - "Provide links to relevant help"
    
  - id: 10
    name: "Help and documentation"
    description: "It's best if the system doesn't need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks."
    examples:
      - "Provide searchable documentation"
      - "Offer contextual help"
      - "Include examples and tutorials"
      - "Make help easily accessible"
