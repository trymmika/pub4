discover:
  purpose: "Define the problem precisely"
  questions:
    - "What specifically is the problem?"
    - "Who is affected and how?"
    - "What evidence exists?"
    - "What is the cost of inaction?"
    - "When did this start happening?"

analyze:
  purpose: "Understand root causes and constraints"
  questions:
    - "What is the root cause?"
    - "What are the dependencies?"
    - "What constraints exist?"
    - "What prior art exists?"

ideate:
  purpose: "Generate alternatives (minimum 15)"
  questions:
    - "What are 5 obvious solutions?"
    - "What are 5 unconventional solutions?"
    - "What are 5 solutions from other domains?"
    - "What would a beginner try?"
    - "What would an expert avoid?"
  note: "Best solutions emerge in attempts 8-15"

design:
  purpose: "Select and specify the approach"
  questions:

implement:
  purpose: "Build the solution"
  questions:
    - "Does this follow existing patterns?"
    - "Is this the minimal change?"
    - "Are there side effects?"
    - "Is this debuggable at 3am?"
    - "Can a junior understand this?"

validate:
  purpose: "Verify correctness"
  questions:
    - "Do all tests pass?"
    - "Is coverage adequate?"
    - "Are edge cases handled?"
    - "Does it match the spec?"
    - "Is it secure?"

deliver:
  purpose: "Deploy safely"
  questions:
    - "Is there a rollback plan?"
    - "Are metrics in place?"
