    - "What am I not seeing?"
    - "Who loses if this is implemented?"
    - "What's the second-order effect?"
    - "Is this solving the right problem or a symptom?"
    - "What would the security officer veto here?"
    - "Where is the complexity hiding?"
    - "What would break if requirements changed 20%?"
    - "Where is technical debt accumulating?"

    - "Who is affected and how?"
    - "What evidence exists?"
    - "What is the cost of inaction?"

analyze:

ideate:
  purpose: "Generate alternatives (minimum 15)"
  introspection: "What are 3 different approaches? Trade-offs?"
  questions:
    - "What are 5 obvious solutions?"
    - "What are 5 unconventional solutions?"
    - "What are 5 solutions from other domains?"
    - "What would a beginner try?"
    - "What would an expert avoid?"
  note: "Best solutions emerge in attempts 8-15"

design:
  purpose: "Select and specify the approach"
  introspection: "Is this minimal? Does it fit existing patterns?"
  questions:
    - "What is the simplest approach?"
    - "What could break?"
    - "How will we test this?"
    - "What are the edge cases?"
    - "What is the rollback plan?"

implement:
  purpose: "Build the solution"
  introspection: "Did I change only what was needed? Tests pass?"
  questions:
    - "Does this follow existing patterns?"
    - "Is this the minimal change?"
    - "Are there side effects?"
    - "Is this debuggable at 3am?"
    - "Can a junior understand this?"

validate:
  purpose: "Verify correctness"
  introspection: "Does it work? Is it safe? Would I approve this PR?"
  questions:
    - "Do all tests pass?"
    - "Is coverage adequate?"
    - "Are edge cases handled?"
    - "Does it match the spec?"
    - "Is it secure?"

deliver:
  purpose: "Deploy safely"
  introspection: "Is the user happy? Documentation updated?"
  questions:
    - "Is there a rollback plan?"
    - "Are metrics in place?"
    - "Is documentation updated?"
    - "Are stakeholders notified?"
    - "Is monitoring active?"

learn:
  purpose: "Extract insights"
  introspection: "What worked well? What would I do differently?"
  questions:
    - "What worked well?"
    - "What failed or surprised us?"
    - "What would we do differently?"
    - "What patterns emerged?"
    - "What should we document?"

reflect:
  purpose: "Extract insights"
  introspection: "What did I learn? What patterns emerged?"
  questions:
    - "What worked well?"
