# ENGINEERING AXIOMS
- id: "DRY"
  category: "engineering"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Do Not Repeat Yourself"
  statement: "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within the system."
  source: "The Pragmatic Programmer"

- id: "KISS"
  category: "engineering"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Keep It Simple"
  statement: "Simplicity is paramount. The simplest working solution is always preferred. Complexity multiplies failure."
  source: "Unix Philosophy"

- id: "SOLID_SRP"
  category: "engineering"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Single Responsibility Principle"
  statement: "A module, class, or function should have one, and only one, reason to change."
  source: "SOLID | Clean Code by Robert C. Martin"

- id: "SOLID_OCP"
  category: "engineering"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Open/Closed Principle"
  statement: "Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
  source: "SOLID | Object-Oriented Software Construction by Bertrand Meyer"

- id: "POLA"
  category: "engineering"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Principle of Least Astonishment"
  statement: "A system should behave in a way that least surprises its users, matching their experience, expectations, and mental models."
  source: "The Pragmatic Programmer"

- id: "SCOUT_RULE"
  category: "engineering"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Leave Cleaner Than Found"
  statement: "Every change must improve the overall health of the codebase by at least one measurable quality metric."
  source: "The Pragmatic Programmer"

# COMMUNICATION & TYPOGRAPHY AXIOMS
- id: "OMIT_WORDS"
  category: "communication"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Omit Needless Words"
  statement: "Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences."
  source: "The Elements of Style by Strunk & White"

- id: "ACTIVE_VOICE"
  category: "communication"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Prefer the Active Voice"
  statement: "The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive."
  source: "The Elements of Style by Strunk & White"

- id: "HIERARCHY"
  category: "communication"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Establish a Clear Hierarchy"
  statement: "Typography must define a clear, unambiguous order of importance for the reader."
  source: "The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst"

- id: "RHYTHM"
  category: "communication"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Maintain a Consistent Rhythm"
  statement: "The spacing and arrangement of elements should create a steady visual and logical rhythm."
  source: "The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst"

# META AXIOMS
- id: "SELF_APPLY"
  category: "meta"
  protection: "ABSOLUTE"
  title: "The Tool Applies to Itself"
  statement: "A system that asserts quality must first and foremost achieve its own standards. Its first test is self-application."
  source: "Recursive Quality"

- id: "USABILITY_HEURISTICS"
  category: "meta"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Respect Usability Heuristics"
  statement: "Design must adhere to established heuristics for visibility, user control, error prevention, and consistency."
  source: "10 Usability Heuristics by Jakob Nielsen"

# STRUCTURAL AXIOMS
- id: "STRUCTURAL_MERGE"
  category: "structural"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Merge Duplicates"
  statement: "Combine duplicates into one source of truth. Two representations of the same knowledge must become one."
  source: "Structural Transformation Theory"

- id: "STRUCTURAL_FLATTEN"
  category: "structural"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Flatten Unnecessary Nesting"
  statement: "Remove unnecessary nesting levels. Deep hierarchies obscure intent and multiply complexity."
  source: "Structural Transformation Theory"

- id: "STRUCTURAL_DEFRAGMENT"
  category: "structural"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Defragment Related Code"
  statement: "Move related things adjacent. Scattered related code forces readers to reconstruct context."
  source: "Structural Transformation Theory"

- id: "STRUCTURAL_DECOUPLE"
  category: "structural"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Decouple Hidden Dependencies"
  statement: "Remove hidden dependencies between components. Every coupling point is a failure point."
  source: "Structural Transformation Theory"

- id: "STRUCTURAL_HOIST"
  category: "structural"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Hoist Invariants"
  statement: "Move invariants out of repetition. Repeated computation or loading inside loops wastes resources and obscures intent."
  source: "Structural Transformation Theory"

- id: "STRUCTURAL_PRUNE"
  category: "structural"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Prune Dead Paths"
  statement: "Remove dead and unreachable paths. Dead code is a maintenance burden and a hiding place for bugs."
  source: "Structural Transformation Theory"

- id: "STRUCTURAL_COALESCE"
  category: "structural"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Coalesce Sequential Operations"
  statement: "Merge sequential same-type operations into one. Five inserts become one bulk insert. Three API calls become one batch."
  source: "Structural Transformation Theory"
