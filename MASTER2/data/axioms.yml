- id: "DRY"
  category: "engineering"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Do Not Repeat Yourself"

# COMMUNICATION & TYPOGRAPHY AXIOMS
- id: "OMIT_WORDS"
  category: "communication"

# META AXIOMS

  category: "meta"
  protection: "ABSOLUTE"
  title: "The Tool Applies to Itself"

  category: "structural"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Flatten Unnecessary Nesting"

  source: "Structural Transformation Theory"

- id: "STRUCTURAL_DEFRAGMENT"

- id: "STRUCTURAL_PRUNE"
  category: "structural"
  protection: "PROTECTED"
  title: "Prune Dead Paths"

- id: "STRUCTURAL_COALESCE"
  category: "structural"

  statement: "Order code by importance first, then by logical flow. Public API at top, private helpers at bottom. Within methods: setup, action, cleanup. Constants before methods. Requires before definitions."
