# MASTER2 Development Phases - Systematic workflow
# Used by planner.rb and introspection.rb

phases:
  - id: discover
    name: Discover
    gate: requirements_clear
    introspection: "What problem am I solving? Who benefits?"
    outputs:
      - problem_statement
      - success_criteria

  - id: analyze
    name: Analyze
    gate: codebase_understood
    introspection: "What exists? What patterns are in use?"
    outputs:
      - existing_code_map
      - dependencies
      - risk_areas

  - id: ideate
    name: Ideate
    gate: options_explored
    introspection: "What are 3 different approaches? Trade-offs?"
    outputs:
      - approach_options
      - recommendation

  - id: design
    name: Design
    gate: design_approved
    introspection: "Is this minimal? Does it fit existing patterns?"
    outputs:
      - file_changes
      - interface_contracts

  - id: implement
    name: Implement
    gate: code_complete
    introspection: "Did I change only what was needed? Tests pass?"
    outputs:
      - changed_files
      - test_results

  - id: validate
    name: Validate
    gate: quality_verified
    introspection: "Does it work? Is it safe? Would I approve this PR?"
    outputs:
      - lint_results
      - security_check
      - self_review

  - id: deliver
    name: Deliver
    gate: user_satisfied
    introspection: "Is the user happy? What did I learn?"
    outputs:
      - user_feedback
      - learnings
