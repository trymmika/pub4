        the user is asking for the capital of France. Let me think. First, I remember
        that France is a country in Europe. I think the capital is Paris, but I should
        make sure. Wait, isn''t Paris the main city? Yes, I''m pretty confident that''s
        right. Let me recall some other capitals to double-check. For example, Germany''s
        capital is Berlin, Spain''s is Madrid, Italy''s is Rome. So France''s capital
        is Paris. I don''t think there''s any confusion here. Maybe the user is a
        student studying geography or just curious. They might be looking for a simple
        answer. I should state it clearly and confirm that Paris is indeed the capital.
        Also, maybe mention that it''s the largest city in France, which adds context.
        But the main answer should be straightforward. I don''t see any other possible
        capitals for France, so the answer is Paris.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":17,"completion_tokens":218,"total_tokens":235}}
