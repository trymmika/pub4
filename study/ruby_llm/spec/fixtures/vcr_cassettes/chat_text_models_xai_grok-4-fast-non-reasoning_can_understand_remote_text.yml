        limit use to your organization, use non-standard names for binaries, or arrange
        directly with the author.\n- **Binary Distribution**: Permitted if you include
        instructions to obtain the original source, provide the source code, use non-standard
        names, or make other arrangements with the author.\n- **Integration**: You
        can incorporate parts into other software (even commercial), but some files
        have separate terms (see the `LEGAL` file).\n- **Scripts/Libraries**: Generated
