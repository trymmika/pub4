For a list of those files and their specific conditions, you must consult the `LEGAL` file.\n*   **User-Generated Content:** Scripts and library files supplied to or produced by Ruby do not automatically fall under Ruby's copyright; they belong to their creators, can be sold commercially, and can be aggregated with Ruby.\n*   **No Warranties:** The software is provided \"AS IS\" without any express or implied warranties, including MERCHANTABILITY and FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\nIn essence, it's a permissive open-source license that allows for broad use, modification, and distribution of Ruby, with specific conditions for how modified or binary versions are handled, and a crucial note about checking the `LEGAL` file for components not covered by this license."
