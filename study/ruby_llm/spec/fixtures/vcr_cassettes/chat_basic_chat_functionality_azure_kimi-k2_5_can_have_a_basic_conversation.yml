        here:\n1. It could be a test to see if I''ll answer a simple question\n2.
        It could be a reference to the \"2 + 2 = 5\" from Orwell''s 1984 (though that''s
        usually phrased as \"2 + 2 = 5\")\n3. It could be base-related (e.g., in base

        string concatenation (though that would usually be specified)\n\nGiven no
        additional context, the most helpful and correct answer is simply 4. I should
        provide the answer clearly without overcomplicating it, though I could briefly
        mention that this assumes standard base-10 arithmetic if I want to be thorough.\n\nActually,
