        creator of the Ruby programming language is **Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto**.
        He is a Japanese programmer and software engineer who designed and developed
        Ruby in the mid-1990s. The language was first released in 1995, and its name
        is derived from the gemstone \"ruby,\" which Matsumoto chose as a playful
        nod to the language''s elegance and simplicity. Matsumoto is also known by
        his nickname \"Matz,\" which he adopted early in his career. Ruby is celebrated

        web development, especially with frameworks like Rails. But I''m not sure
        about the creator''s name.\n\nWait, I think the creator''s name is Yukihiro

        there aren''t any other people associated with Ruby''s creation. Sometimes
        there are contributors, but the main creator is usually the one who designed
        and first implemented the language.\n\nMatsumoto is a Japanese programmer,
        right? He worked at a company called NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation),
        I believe. He started developing Ruby in the mid-90s. The first version was
        released around 1995. I think the name Ruby comes from the word \"ruby\" as
        in the gemstone, which is a play on the word \"Ruby\" as in the programming
        language, but maybe there''s a specific reason for that name. However, the
        focus here is on the creator, not the name.\n\nWait, sometimes people confuse
        Ruby with other languages. For example, there''s a Ruby on Rails framework,
        but that''s a framework built on Ruby, not the language itself. So the creator
        of the language is Matsumoto. To confirm, I can think of sources: Ruby''s
        official website or documentation usually mentions Matsumoto as the creator.
        Also, he''s known as Matz, which is a nickname he adopted. \n\nI should also
        consider if there''s any other figure associated with Ruby''s development.
        For instance, maybe someone else contributed significantly, but the primary
        creator is Matsumoto. I don''t recall any other names being credited as the
