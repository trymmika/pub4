        let''s break this down. The question is about a magic mirror that shows your
        future self, but only if you ask a question it cannot answer truthfully. So,
        the mirror reveals your future self only when the question posed is one that
        the mirror cannot answer truthfully.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what
        it means for the mirror to \"not be able to answer truthfully.\" This implies
        that the question should be one that the mirror cannot answer without lying
        or without contradiction. In logic, such questions often involve self-reference
        or contradictions.\n\nOne classic example of a question that cannot be answered
        truthfully is the liar paradox: \"Is the answer to this question no?\" But
        does this fit the context? The mirror shows your future self only if the question
        is one it cannot answer truthfully.\n\nAnother angle is to think about questions
        that force the mirror into a paradox if it tries to answer truthfully. For
        instance, a question that references itself or its own capabilities.\n\nLet
        me consider the question: \"Will you show me my future self?\" If the mirror
        can show the future self, it would have to answer \"yes\" truthfully. But
        the condition is that the question must be one it cannot answer truthfully.
        So this might not work because the mirror could answer truthfully.\n\nWhat
        about a question like: \"Are you not going to show me my future self?\" If
        the mirror is supposed to show the future self only when it cannot answer
        truthfully, it might not be straightforward.\n\nPerhaps a better approach
        is to use a question that creates a paradox if the mirror tries to answer
        truthfully. For example: \"If I ask you to not show me my future self, will
        you do it?\" But this might not directly relate to the condition.\n\nLet me
        think about the mirror''s limitations. The mirror shows the future self only
        if the question is one it cannot answer truthfully. So, the question must
        be such that any truthful answer would be impossible or contradictory.\n\nOne
        classic example is a question that forces a paradox, such as: \"Will you not
        show me my future self if I ask this question?\" If the mirror is supposed
        to show the future self when it cannot answer truthfully, then the question
        must be one that cannot be answered without contradiction.\n\nLet me formalize
        this:\n\nLet the question be Q.\n\nThe mirror shows the future self if Q is
        a question that the mirror cannot answer truthfully.\n\nSuppose the question
        is: \"Will you not show me my future self?\"\n\n- If the mirror answers \"yes,\"
        it means it will not show the future self. But if it does not show the future
        self, then the answer is truthful, which contradicts the condition that the
        question must be one it cannot answer truthfully.\n- If the mirror answers
        \"no,\" it means it will show the future self. But if it shows the future
        self, then the answer \"no\" is truthful, which again contradicts the condition.\n\nTherefore,
        the question \"Will you not show me my future self?\" is one that the mirror
        cannot answer truthfully, because both possible answers lead to a contradiction.
        Hence, the mirror must show the future self in response to this question.\n\nNow,
        what would the mirror reveal about the answer it gives? Since the mirror cannot
        answer truthfully, it might give a false answer or perhaps refuse to answer,
        but since it''s a magic mirror, it might show the future self and perhaps
        reveal that the answer is false or paradoxical.\n\nSo, the question to ask
        is: \"Will you not show me my future self?\"\n\nThe mirror cannot answer this
        truthfully, so it must show the future self. As for what it reveals about
        the answer it gives, since the question is paradoxical, the mirror might show
        the future self but indicate that the answer to the question is false or that
        it cannot provide a truthful answer.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning.\n\nSuppose
        the mirror is honest and must show the future self if the question cannot
        be answered truthfully.\n\nQuestion: \"Will you not show me my future self?\"\n\nPossible
        answers:\n\n1. If the mirror answers \"yes\" (it will not show the future
        self):\n   - If it answers \"yes\" truthfully, it will not show the future
        self. But then the answer is truthful, which violates the condition that the
        question must be one it cannot answer truthfully. So this cannot be.\n\n2.
        If the mirror answers \"no\" (it will show the future self):\n   - If it answers
        \"no\" truthfully, it will show the future self. But then the answer is truthful,
        which again violates the condition.\n\nThus, the mirror cannot answer truthfully,
        so it must show the future self.\n\nNow, what does the mirror reveal about
        the answer it gives? Since it cannot answer truthfully, it might show the
        future self and perhaps say something like \"This question has no truthful
        answer,\" or it might show the future self without giving a verbal answer,
        as the act of showing the future self is its response to the unanswerable
        question.\n\nSo, the question is \"Will you not show me my future self?\"
        and the mirror reveals that this question cannot be answered truthfully by
        showing the future self instead of providing an answer.\n\nNow, let''s structure
        the response."}]},{"type":"text","text":"To solve this problem, we need to
        identify a question that the magic mirror cannot answer truthfully, which
        will trigger it to show your future self. The key is to construct a question
        that creates a logical paradox if the mirror attempts to answer truthfully.
        One such question is: \"Will you not show me my future self?\"\n\nLet''s analyze
        this question:\n\n1. If the mirror answers \"yes\" (it will not show the future
        self), this would mean the mirror is telling the truth, but the condition
        is that the question must be one the mirror cannot answer truthfully. This
        leads to a contradiction because the mirror cannot both show the future self
        and answer \"yes\" truthfully.\n\n2. If the mirror answers \"no\" (it will
        show the future self), this would also be a truthful answer, which again contradicts
        the condition.\n\nSince both possible answers lead to contradictions, the
        mirror cannot answer the question truthfully. Therefore, the mirror must show
        your future self as a response to this question.\n\nIn terms of what the mirror
        reveals about the answer it gives, it might not provide a verbal answer but
        instead show the future self, indicating that the question is unanswerable
        in a truthful manner. The act of showing the future self serves as the response
        to the unanswerable question.\n\nThus, the question to ask is: \"Will you
        not show me my future self?\" and the mirror will reveal your future self
        as it cannot provide a truthful answer to this question.\n\nHere is the response:\n\nThe
        question you should ask is: \"Will you not show me my future self?\"\n\nThe
        mirror, unable to answer this question truthfully (as both possible answers
        lead to a contradiction), will reveal your future self. In doing so, it implicitly
        shows that the question is unanswerable without contradiction, as the act
        of showing your future self is its response to the unanswerable question."}]}}]}'
