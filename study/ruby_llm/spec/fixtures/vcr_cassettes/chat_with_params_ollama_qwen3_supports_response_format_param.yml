        me think. First, I know that the square root of a number is a value that,
        when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So, I need to find a
        number that when squared equals 64.\n\nLet me start by recalling basic multiplication
        facts. 8 times 8 is 64. Wait, yes, 8 squared is 64. But wait, there''s also
        negative numbers to consider. Because (-8) multiplied by (-8) also gives 64.
        However, when people ask for the square root, they usually refer to the principal
        (positive) root unless specified otherwise. \n\nSo, in most mathematical contexts,
        the square root of 64 is 8. But I should check if there''s any chance the
        user might be expecting both positive and negative roots. However, the question
        is straightforward, and the answer is likely just 8. \n\nLet me confirm by
        calculating 8*8. 8*8 is indeed 64. So that''s correct. Therefore, the square
        root of 64 is 8. The JSON object should have the key ''result'' with the value
        8. I need to make sure there''s no mistake here. Maybe I should also consider
        if there''s any other possible answer, but I don''t think so. 64 is a perfect
        square, so its square root is an integer. Yep, 8 is the right answer.\n"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":342,"completion_tokens":10,"total_tokens":352}}
