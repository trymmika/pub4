        let me see. The user wants me to call the any-of params tool for the task
        \"Review PR\" with status \"pending\" and report the result.\n\nFirst, I need
        to understand the tool''s structure. The function provided has parameters
        that use the anyOf DSL. The parameters are status and task. The status can
        be either a string from the enum [\"pending\", \"done\"] or null. The task
        is a string.\n\nSo, the user is specifying the task as \"Review PR\" and the
        status as \"pending\". Both are valid because \"pending\" is in the enum.
        I need to construct the function call with these parameters.\n\nWait, the
        function''s parameters are under any_of_params. The function name might be
        something like any_of_params, but looking back, the tool''s function is described
        as any_of_params with the parameters status and task. But the actual function
        name isn''t clear. Wait, the tools section says \"any_of_params Uses params
        DSL any_of support {object \u003cnil\u003e \u003cnil\u003e [task status] ...}\".
        Hmm, maybe the function is named \"any_of_params\" or perhaps the parameters
        are part of a function. Wait, the initial tool description might be a bit
        confusing. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe tools section has a function with
        parameters that use anyOf. The parameters are status and task. The function''s
        name isn''t explicitly given, but the user mentioned \"call the any-of params
        tool\", so the function name is likely \"any_of_params\". \n\nSo, the arguments
        should be a JSON object with \"task\" set to \"Review PR\" and \"status\"
        set to \"pending\". Since both are valid, the function call should include
        both. Then, the tool will process this and return a result, which I need to
        report.\n\nTherefore, the correct tool call is to use the any_of_params function
        with those arguments. I''ll structure the JSON accordingly.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_069rtz9a","index":0,"type":"function","function":{"name":"any_of_params","arguments":"{\"status\":\"pending\",\"task\":\"Review
