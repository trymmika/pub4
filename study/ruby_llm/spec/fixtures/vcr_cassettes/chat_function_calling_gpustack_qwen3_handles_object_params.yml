        the user wants me to call the object_params tool with a specific window start
        and end. Let me check the function definition again. The function requires
        a window object with start and end in ISO format. The parameters are strict,
        so I need to make sure the keys are exactly as specified. The start is 2025-01-01
        and end is 2025-01-02. I''ll structure the JSON with the window containing
        those dates. No additional properties allowed, so I''ll keep it minimal. Let
        me verify the required fields are present. Yep, start and end are required.
        Alright, that should work.","tool_calls":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"object_params","arguments":"{\"window\":{\"start\":\"2025-01-01\",\"end\":\"2025-01-02\"}}"},"id":"aWKaVUu9iM0uCjn4pzj53B3CcRBMlkg0"}]}}],"created":1770738867,"model":"qwen3","system_fingerprint":"b7981-98e57ca42","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":188,"prompt_tokens":253,"total_tokens":441,"time_to_first_token_ms":21259,"time_per_output_token_ms":0,"tokens_per_second":0},"id":"chatcmpl-vyzZURfikZ44yyRsj75DEyVxZLZCDiMi","timings":{"cache_n":51,"prompt_n":202,"prompt_ms":4112.983,"prompt_per_token_ms":20.36130198019802,"prompt_per_second":49.11277289500102,"predicted_n":188,"predicted_ms":17083.924,"predicted_per_token_ms":90.87193617021276,"predicted_per_second":11.004497561567238}}'
