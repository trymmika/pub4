        `license.txt` file provided contains the **license terms** for **Ruby**, a
        programming language created by Yukihiro \"Matz\" Matsumoto. It outlines the
        conditions under which you can redistribute, modify, and use Ruby''s source
        code. Here''s a breakdown of its key points:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Copyright
        and Licensing Overview**\n- **Author**: Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz)  \n- **License
        Type**: A **modified version of the 2-clause BSD license** (also called the
        \"revised BSD license\").  \n- **Key Principle**: Ruby is **free software**,
        but it comes with specific conditions for redistribution and modification.\n\n---\n\n###
        **2. Key License Conditions**\n\n#### **Clause 1: Verbatim Copies**\n- You
        can **copy and distribute** the source code **verbatim** (unchanged) without
        restrictions.  \n- **Requirement**: You must **duplicate all original copyright
        notices** and **disclaimers**.\n\n#### **Clause 2: Modifications**\n- If you
        **modify the software**, you must do **at least one** of the following:\n  -
        **(a)** Place your modifications in the **Public Domain** or make them freely
        available (e.g., post them to Usenet or include them in the software).\n  -
        **(b)** Use the modified software **only within your organization**.\n  -
        **(c)** Rename non-standard binaries and include instructions on where to
        get the original software.\n  - **(d)** Make other distribution arrangements
        with the author (Matz).\n\n#### **Clause 3: Binary Distribution**\n- If you
        **distribute the software in binary form**, you must do **at least one** of
        the following:\n  - **(a)** Include instructions on where to get the original
        source code.\n  - **(b)** Provide the **machine-readable source code** with
        the binary.\n  - **(c)** Rename non-standard binaries and include instructions
        on where to get the original software.\n  - **(d)** Make other distribution
        arrangements with the author.\n\n#### **Clause 4: Integration with Other Software**\n-
        You can **modify and include parts of Ruby** in other software (even commercial),
        **except** for files not written by Matz.  \n- For details on which files
        are excluded and their licensing, refer to the **`LEGAL`** file.\n\n#### **Clause
        5: Scripts and Output Files**\n- **Scripts and library files** generated by
        Ruby (e.g., input/output files) **do not inherit Ruby''s copyright**.  \n-
        They belong to the **creator of those files** and can be sold or used commercially.\n\n####
        **Clause 6: Warranty Disclaimer**\n- The software is provided **\"AS IS\"**
        without any warranty, including **implied warranties** of **merchantability**
        or **fitness for a particular purpose**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Additional Notes**\n-
        The license references two other files:\n  - **`BSDL`**: The original 2-clause
        BSD license text.\n  - **`LEGAL`**: A file listing files in the Ruby distribution
        that are **not under these terms** (e.g., third-party libraries or components).\n\n---\n\n###
        **4. Summary**\nThis license is **permissive** but includes specific conditions
        to ensure proper attribution, freedom to modify, and restrictions on distributing
        modified or binary versions. It allows Ruby to be used in both open-source
        and commercial projects, provided the conditions are met. Always check the
        `LEGAL` file for exceptions or additional restrictions.","reasoning_content":"Okay,
        let me try to figure out what''s in this license.txt file. So the user provided
        the contents of the file, and I need to explain what it contains. Let me start
        by reading through the text carefully.\n\nFirst, the file mentions that Ruby
        is copyrighted free software by Yukihiro Matsumoto, also known as Matz. The
        license allows redistribution and modification under certain terms. The first
        clause talks about verbatim copies of the source code, requiring duplication
        of copyright notices and disclaimers. That sounds like the standard \"you
        can copy it as long as you keep the notices\" part.\n\nThen there are several
        conditions. The second point allows modification, but you have to do one of
        four things: put modifications in the public domain, use them within your
        company, name non-standard binaries with instructions, or make other arrangements.
        That seems to cover different scenarios for modified code.\n\nThird condition
        is about distributing binaries. You have to do one of four things again, similar
        to the second condition but for binaries. The fourth condition mentions including
        parts of the software into other software, but some files aren''t under these
        terms, so you need to check the LEGAL file for those. \n\nThe fifth point
        says that scripts and library files generated by the software aren''t automatically
        under the copyright, so their rights belong to the creator. The sixth point
        is the standard \"as is\" disclaimer with no warranties.\n\nWait, the user
        might be looking for a summary of the license. So I should structure the answer
        by listing each condition and explain what it means. Also, note that this
        is a 2-clause BSD license, but modified. The original BSD license is more
        permissive, but this one has specific conditions for modifications and distribution.
        \n\nI should mention the author, the key points of each clause, and maybe
        note that it''s a modified BSD-style license. Also, the mention of the BSDL
        file and LEGAL file as references. The user might not know the terms, so explaining
        each clause in simple terms would help. \n\nI need to make sure I don''t miss
        any important details. Let me check again: the first clause is about copying,
        the second about modifying, third about distributing binaries, fourth about
        combining with other software, fifth about generated files, sixth about disclaimers.
        Yes. \n\nAlso, note that some files are not under these terms, so the LEGAL
        file is important. The user might be trying to understand the licensing terms
        for using Ruby, so clarifying that this is the license for Ruby''s source
        code, and the conditions for redistribution and modification. \n\nI think
        that''s all. Now, I''ll structure the answer to explain each part clearly."}}],"created":1770737776,"model":"qwen3","system_fingerprint":"b7981-98e57ca42","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":1270,"prompt_tokens":544,"total_tokens":1814,"time_to_first_token_ms":148948,"time_per_output_token_ms":0,"tokens_per_second":0},"id":"chatcmpl-4PiUUwTAarZZL0N00atrCKP9ysZlJEXz","timings":{"cache_n":0,"prompt_n":544,"prompt_ms":11303.018,"prompt_per_token_ms":20.77760661764706,"prompt_per_second":48.12873871385501,"predicted_n":1270,"predicted_ms":137616.536,"predicted_per_token_ms":108.35947716535432,"predicted_per_second":9.228542128105884}}'
