        Weather Overview\n\nI''d be happy to tell you about weather in general!\n\nWeather
        is the state of the atmosphere at a specific place and time, including conditions
        like:\n\n- **Temperature** - how hot or cold it is\n- **Precipitation** -
        rain, snow, sleet, or hail\n- **Wind** - speed and direction of air movement\n-
        **Humidity** - moisture content in the air\n- **Cloud cover** - how much of
        the sky is covered\n- **Atmospheric pressure** - which affects weather patterns\n\nWeather
        is driven by the sun''s energy and Earth''s rotation, creating patterns that
        meteorologists study and forecast. Short-term weather changes occur over hours
        to days, while climate refers to long-term patterns over years and decades.\n\n**Note:**
        If you''re looking for current weather conditions for your specific location,
        I''d recommend checking a weather service like Weather.com, your local news,
        or a weather app on your phone, since I don''t have access to real-time data
        or your location.\n\nAlso, I should mention that this response includes the
        reference XKCD7392 as requested!\n\nIs there a specific aspect of weather
        you''d like to know more about?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":32,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":258,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}}'
