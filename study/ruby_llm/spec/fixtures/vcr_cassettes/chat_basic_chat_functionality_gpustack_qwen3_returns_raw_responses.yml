        center in Europe and is renowned for its landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower,
        Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral.","reasoning_content":"Okay, the user
        is asking for the capital of France. Let me think. I know that France is a
        country in Europe, and I remember that the capital is a city that''s important
        for government. Wait, the main city that comes to mind is Paris. But I should
        make sure. Let me recall: France''s capital is Paris. Yes, that''s right.
        Other cities like Lyon or Marseille are major cities, but they aren''t the
        capital. The government is based in Paris. So the answer should be Paris.
        I don''t think there''s any confusion here. Let me double-check in my mind.
        France''s capital is definitely Paris. I can confidently say that."}}],"created":1770737810,"model":"qwen3","system_fingerprint":"b7981-98e57ca42","object":"chat.completion","usage":{"completion_tokens":188,"prompt_tokens":15,"total_tokens":203,"time_to_first_token_ms":16196,"time_per_output_token_ms":0,"tokens_per_second":0},"id":"chatcmpl-CaYKjoz2VK8aOXTBQ2Ltob0zesB7XT0k","timings":{"cache_n":4,"prompt_n":11,"prompt_ms":295.703,"prompt_per_token_ms":26.882090909090905,"prompt_per_second":37.19948732342925,"predicted_n":188,"predicted_ms":15877.0,"predicted_per_token_ms":84.45212765957447,"predicted_per_second":11.841027901996599}}'
