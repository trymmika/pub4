        the user wants me to call the array params tool with the tags [\"red\", \"blue\"]
        and get the combined tags. Let me check the function definition.\n\nThe tool''s
        function is described as taking an array of strings called tags. The parameters
        use the array DSL, so I need to structure the arguments correctly. The user
        provided the tags as a list, so I should pass them as a JSON array. \n\nWait,
        the function''s parameters are expecting an object with a tags array. So the
        arguments should be {\"tags\": [\"red\", \"blue\"]}. I need to make sure the
        JSON is properly formatted. Let me verify again. The function''s parameters
        are defined as {\"tags\":{\"type\":\"array\",\"items\":{\"type\":\"string\"}}},
        so the key is \"tags\" and the value is the array. \n\nYes, that''s correct.
        So the tool call should have the name \"array_params\" and the arguments as
        specified. I''ll format the JSON accordingly.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_9mscv28i","index":0,"type":"function","function":{"name":"array_params","arguments":"{\"tags\":[\"red\",\"blue\"]}"}}]},"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":162,"completion_tokens":226,"total_tokens":388}}
