        to the information I retrieved, **Ruby** is considered the best language to
        learn. \n\nRuby is a dynamic, open-source programming language that focuses
        on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to
        read and easy to write. Ruby is particularly well-known for being the language
        behind the Ruby on Rails web framework, which has been used to build many
        popular websites and applications.\n\nSome key advantages of learning Ruby
        include:\n- Clean, readable syntax that''s beginner-friendly\n- Strong community
        support and extensive documentation\n- Excellent for web development with
        Ruby on Rails\n- Great for rapid prototyping and development\n- Used by many
        startups and established companies\n\nWould you like to know more about why
        Ruby might be a good choice or have specific questions about learning it?"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":376,"completion_tokens":154,"total_tokens":530,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":320},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":320,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":56},"system_fingerprint":"fp_eaab8d114b_prod0820_fp8_kvcache"}'
