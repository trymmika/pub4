        the user wants me to call the object params tool with a specific window start
        and end date. Let me check the function definition again. The function is
        called \"object_params\" and it takes a window object with start and end as
        ISO strings. The user provided start as 2025-01-01 and end as 2025-01-02.
        I need to structure the arguments correctly. Let me make sure the dates are
        in the right format, like YYYY-MM-DD. Also, the parameters should be within
        a window object. So the JSON should have the name as \"object_params\" and
        the arguments as a JSON object with window containing start and end. I think
        that''s all. Let me put that into the tool_call format.\n","tool_calls":[{"id":"call_jiavonlm","index":0,"type":"function","function":{"name":"object_params","arguments":"{\"window\":{\"end\":\"2025-01-02\",\"start\":\"2025-01-01\"}}"}}]},"finish_reason":"tool_calls"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":198,"completion_tokens":212,"total_tokens":410}}
