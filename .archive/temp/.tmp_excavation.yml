  - {name: security_auditor, perspective: "assumes everything is potential attack vector"}
  - {name: maintenance_engineer, perspective: "thinks about debugging this at 3am in production"}
  - {name: junior_developer, perspective: "if they cannot understand it the code is too complex"}
  - {name: senior_architect, perspective: "sees 5 year implications and technical debt accumulation"}

integration_plan:
  master_yml:
    - ADD: workflow phases (6 phases)
    - ADD: convergence algorithm (epsilon-based)
    - UPDATE: evidence weights (align with v509)
  
  principles_yml:
    - ADD: 5 SOLID principles as separate principles
    - ADD: FAIL_FAST principle
    - ADD: EXPLICIT_OVER_IMPLICIT principle
    - UPDATE: Version 0.5.11 → 0.6.0 (62 principles)
  
  steroids_yml:
    - EXPAND: personas (6 → 8, add skeptic + minimalist)
    - UPDATE: temperature usage (align 0.1/0.5/0.9)
  
  biases_yml:
    - ADD: cognitive_biases from v509
    - ADD: common_pitfalls catalog

roi_estimate:
  workflow: "10x (systematic decision-making)"
  personas: "5x (better adversarial review)"
  solid: "3x (clearer architecture principles)"
  total: "Foundational upgrade, benefits all future work"
