typography:
  version: "4.0"
  authority: "bringhurst"
  
  meta_principles:
    foundation: |
      Typography exists to honor content. All typographic decisions must serve 
      the reader and the text. When in doubt, choose clarity over cleverness.
    
    grand_design: |
      Read the text before designing it. Understand its structure, rhythm, and 
      purpose. Let the content inform every typographic choice.

  ## CHAPTER 2: RHYTHM AND PROPORTION
  
  rhythm_proportion:
    
    # 2.1 HORIZONTAL MOTION
    horizontal:
      
      measure:
        rule: "Optimal line length is 45-75 characters (66 is ideal)"
        implementation:
          - css: "max-width: 33em" # at 12pt, ~66 chars
          - check: "Count characters in typical line"
          - exception: "Narrow columns (newspapers): 40-50 characters acceptable"
        
        rationale: |
          Too-long lines tire the eye and make it hard to find the next line.
          Too-short lines break the reading rhythm and waste space.
      
      word_spacing:
        rule: "Word spaces should be 1/4em to 1/3em (optimum: 1/4em)"
        implementation:
          - css: "word-spacing: normal" # browser default is good
          - check: "Visual inspection - should look 'invisible'"
        
        danger: "Avoid word spaces wider than 1/2em or narrower than 1/5em"
      
      letter_spacing:
        rule: "Lowercase should not be letter-spaced (tracked) except for design effect"
        implementation:
          - css: "letter-spacing: normal"
          - exception: "All caps: +0.05em to +0.15em"
          - exception: "Small caps: +0.05em"
        
        capitals:
          rule: "Add slight tracking to all-caps text"
          css: "letter-spacing: 0.05em to 0.15em"
        
        small_caps:
          rule: "Add slight tracking to small caps for optical balance"
          css: "letter-spacing: 0.05em"
    
    # 2.2 VERTICAL MOTION
    vertical:
      
      baseline_grid:
        rule: "Establish and maintain a baseline grid for vertical rhythm"
        implementation:
          - define: "Choose base unit (6pt or 8pt for print, 4px or 6px for screen)"
          - line_height: "Must be multiple of base unit"
          - spacing: "All vertical spacing must align to grid"
        
        example:
          base_unit: "6pt"
          body_size: "12pt"
          line_height: "24pt (4 × 6pt)"
          section_spacing: "48pt (8 × 6pt)"
      
      leading:
        rule: "Add 20% leading for body text (e.g., 10pt/12pt, 12pt/14.4pt)"
        implementation:
          - calculation: "line-height = font-size × 1.2 to 1.5"
          - print: "1.2 is minimum, 1.4-1.5 optimal"
          - screen: "1.5-1.6 recommended for readability"
        
        adjustments:
          longer_lines: "Add more leading (up to 1.6)"
          shorter_lines: "Can use less leading (down to 1.2)"
          sans_serif: "Needs more leading than serif"
          large_x_height: "Needs more leading"
      
      vertical_spacing:
        rule: "Space paragraphs and headings based on baseline grid"
        
        paragraphs:
          separation_method_1:
            method: "Indent first line (2em), no space between"
            implementation:
              - "p + p { text-indent: 2em; margin-top: 0; }"
          
          separation_method_2:
            method: "Space between (1 line), no indent"
            implementation:
              - "p + p { margin-top: 1.5em; text-indent: 0; }"
          
          first_paragraph:
            rule: "Never indent first paragraph after heading"
            implementation:
              - "h1 + p, h2 + p { text-indent: 0; }"
        
        headings:
          spacing:
            rule: "More space before heading than after"
            implementation:
              - "h2 { margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 1em; }"
            
            rationale: "Heading belongs to text that follows, not precedes"
  
  ## CHAPTER 3: HARMONY AND COUNTERPOINT
  
  harmony_counterpoint:
    
    consistency:
      rule: "Use as few different sizes, weights, and styles as needed"
      implementation:
        - "Maximum 3-4 font sizes in most documents"
        - "Maximum 2 font families (one serif, one sans)"
        - "Be consistent with spacing and alignment"
      
      hierarchy:
        levels:
          - level: 1
            element: "h1"
            size: "2.0-2.5 × body"
            weight: "300-400 (light to regular)"
            spacing: "Large space before (3-4 lines)"
          
          - level: 2
            element: "h2"
            size: "1.5-1.75 × body"
            weight: "400-600 (regular to semibold)"
            spacing: "3 lines before, 1 line after"
          
          - level: 3
            element: "h3"
            size: "1.25-1.33 × body"
            weight: "600 (semibold)"
            spacing: "2 lines before, 0.5 lines after"
    
    contrast:
      rule: "Contrast should be obvious, never timid"
      examples:
        - "If using bold, make it noticeably bold (600+)"
        - "If changing size, change by at least 20%"
        - "If using italic, let it be clearly italic"
      
      danger: "Avoid weak contrast (e.g., 400 weight vs 450 weight)"
    
    optical_alignment:
      rule: "Align to optical edge, not mathematical edge"
      
      hanging_punctuation:
        rule: "Hang punctuation outside text block for optical alignment"
        implementation:
          - "Quotation marks should hang in left margin"
          - "Periods, commas at line end can hang slightly"
          - css: "text-indent: -0.5em on first line with quote"
      
      capitals:
        rule: "Optically align capitals to lowercase, not baseline"
        note: "In list with numbers/bullets, align baseline not cap-height"

        punctuation:
          rule: "Use periods after numbers, or omit punctuation entirely"
          avoid: "Parentheses around numbers: (1) (2) (3)"
      
      bulleted:
        rule: "Use proper bullet (•), not asterisk or hyphen"
        indent: "Hang bullet in margin or use 2-3em indent"
    
    quotations:
      block_quotes:
        rule: "Indent block quotes, use smaller size or italic"
        implementation:
          - indent: "2-3em on left (and optionally right)"
          - size: "90-95% of body size"
          - leading: "Maintain same as body"
      
      inline_quotes:
        rule: "Use proper typographic quotes, not straight quotes"
        characters:
          - opening_double: """ (U+201C)
          - closing_double: """ (U+201D)
          - opening_single: "'" (U+2018)
          - closing_single: "'" (U+2019)
    
    captions:
      rule: "Set captions smaller than body, with less leading"
      implementation:
        - size: "85-90% of body"
        - leading: "80-90% of body leading"
        - style: "May use italic or different weight"

  ## CHAPTER 6: CHOOSING AND COMBINING TYPE
  
  font_selection:
    
    principles:

  ## CHAPTER 7: HISTORICAL INTERLUDE
  
  historical_principles:
    
    respect_history:
      rule: "Understand the historical context of typefaces"
      note: |
        Garamond (1540s) has different personality than
        Helvetica (1957). Choose appropriately.
    
    anachronism:
      avoid: "Using modern fonts for historical content"
      exception: "When creating deliberate contrast"
  
  ## CHAPTER 8: SHAPING THE PAGE
  
  page_geometry:

      test: "Can I justify this decision based on readability or meaning?"
    
    consistency:
      rule: "Be consistent unless inconsistency serves a purpose"
      areas:
        - "Spacing (vertical and horizontal)"

        - "Font sizes and weights"
        - "Punctuation style"
    
    clarity:
      rule: "When in doubt, choose clarity over beauty"
      note: "Beautiful typography that's hard to read has failed"
    
    restraint:
      rule: "Use minimum means for maximum effect"
      corollary: "Add only what serves the content"
    
    whitespace:
      rule: "Whitespace is not empty space—it's active design element"
      application:
        - "Margins frame the text"
        - "Line spacing creates reading rhythm"
        - "Paragraph spacing shows structure"
