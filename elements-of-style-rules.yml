  version: "1.0"
  authorities:
    - "William Strunk Jr."
    - "E.B. White"
  
  meta_principles:
    foundation: |
      Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary 
      words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a 
      drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.
    
    clarity_first: |
      Make every word tell. Write with nouns and verbs. Prefer the specific 
      to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract.

      exceptions:
        - "Not un- forms useful for qualified statements"

      principle: |
        Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, 
        the concrete to the abstract.
      
      application:

        short, but that every word should tell.
    
    loose_sentences:
      rule: "Avoid succession of loose sentences"
      
      loose: |
        "The third concert of the subscription series was given last evening, 
        and a large audience was in attendance. Mr. Edward Appleton was the 
        soloist, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra furnished the instrumental 
        music."

        "At the third concert of the subscription series, given last evening

        Boston Symphony Orchestra furnished the instrumental music."
      
      definition: |
        A loose sentence is one that states the main fact first, then adds 
        explanatory or supplementary matter. While acceptable, succession

      articles_prepositions:
        rule: "Repeat article or preposition for clarity"
        
        ambiguous: "the captain and the crew" (one person or two?)

        clear_one: "the captain and crew"
    
    related_words:

      confusing: "You can call your mother in London and tell her all about George's taking you out to dinner for just two dollars."
      clear: "For just two dollars you can call your mother in London and tell her all about George's taking you out to dinner."
      
      subject_verb:
        confusing: "Wordsworth, in the fifth book of The Excursion, gives a minute description of this church."

      relative_pronoun:
        rule: "Place relative pronoun immediately after antecedent"

  ## AN APPROACH TO STYLE (E.B. White)

  style_principles:
    
    place_yourself:
      rule: "Place yourself in the background"
      
      principle: |
        Write in a way that draws reader's attention to sense and 
        substance, not to mood and temper of author.
      
      bad: "I think that..." (obviously you think it - you wrote it)
      good: State it directly
    
    natural_style:
      rule: "Write in a way that comes naturally"
      
      principle: |
        Write with a smooth and direct approach, using words that 
        come readily. Don't search thesaurus for impressive words.
      
      avoid: "Utilize" when "use" will do
    
    work_rewriting:
      rule: "Work from whole to part - revise and rewrite"
      
      process:
        - "Get it written first"
        - "Then revise for clarity"
        - "Then tighten and polish"
      
      principle: "Great writing is great rewriting"
    
    use_definite_language:
      rule: "Use definite, specific, concrete language"
      
      vague: "nice weather"
      specific: "clear sky, cool breeze"
      
      principle: "Specificity creates vivid images"
    
    omit_needless:
      rule: "Omit needless words - the fundamental rule"
      
      principle: |
        Make every word tell. Eliminate words that serve no purpose.
      
      test: "Can I remove this word without changing meaning?"
    
    avoid_qualifiers:
      rule: "Avoid using qualifiers - rather, very, little, pretty"
      
      weak: "rather interesting"
      strong: "interesting" or "fascinating"
      
      principle: "Qualifiers weaken statements"
    
    be_clear:
      rule: "Clarity is paramount - avoid abstractions"
      
      abstract: "The situation is problematic."
      concrete: "We face three obstacles: time, money, and expertise."
    
    ear_test:
      rule: "Write for the ear - read aloud"
      
      principle: |
        Good prose has rhythm. Read your work aloud to test flow.
      
      test: "Does it sound natural when read?"
    
    no_inject_opinion:
      rule: "Do not inject opinion needlessly"
      
      bad: "Thankfully, we succeeded."
      good: "We succeeded."
      
      exception: "When opinion is the topic"
    
    use_orthodox_spelling:
      rule: "Use standard spelling"
      
      avoid: "thru, tho, nite"
      use: "through, though, night"
    
    prefer_standard:
      rule: "Prefer standard to offbeat"
      
      standard: "walked home"
      offbeat: "ambulated domicileward"
      
      principle: "Clarity over creativity in word choice"
